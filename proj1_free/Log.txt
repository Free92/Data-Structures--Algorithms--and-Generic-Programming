This is the log for proj1 in COP4530 Spring 2014.

Version 1.3: Day 3
		1/31/14
	To-Do:
		-Change everything!
		-Change char to string

Version 1.2: Day 3
		1/31/14
	Done:
		-Fixed displays.  Kind of a brutish way of getting it done, but it works.
	To-Do:
		-Fix sort()
	Notes:
		Going to try and implement a sort outside of the struct.  Actually.  I dunno. I'm tired. Gonna try and look for different ways around it. We'll see how that goes.

Version 1.1.1: Day 2
		1/30/14
	Done:
		-Change to templated struct
		-Instantiate wordCounter and numCounter
	To-Do:
		-Fix displayResults()
		-Fix sorter()

Version 1.1: Day 2
		1/30/14
	Done:
		-Finish all char stuff
			-Display vector
			-Sort Functions
	To-Do:
		-Read in words
		-Read in numbers
	Notes:
		I think I may change the schema of this and use a templated struct, so that I don't have to repeat everything for char, strings, and words and everything.  That way I could just re-use the code and just make changes to adjust for other types.
 
Version 1.0-1.0.1: Day 1
		1/23/14
	Got basic grasp of github and fixing some errors with compilation.  Have my makefile set up and got all of the chars read into a map.  Now I just have to sort it, and then do the other two functions.
	To-Do:
	--Sort the characters based on value and not key
	--Split the chars into strings and integers and sort those
	Overall it seems pretty easy and I think I should be able to finish it in time for office hours on Tuesday.

Version 0: Initial version trying to learn how to use github.
